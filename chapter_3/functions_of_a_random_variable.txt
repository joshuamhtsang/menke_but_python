Q) Derive the distribution of the kinetic energy of a car after acclerating for 100m

An experiment is devised to measure the velocity of a car after accelerating for 100m from 
stationary. A speed camera is setup at the end of a 100m stretch of road.  After many 
repeats of the experiment, it is observed that the velocity of the car is uniformly distributed
in the range of velocities [v_min, v_max] = [55, 65] ( units: ms^(-1) ).

How is the kinetic energy of the car distributed if kinetic energy, E_ke,  is related to 
velocity through the relationship:

E_ke(v) = 1/2 * m * v^2

A) In this case, the measurable, random variable is v by the speed camera.  The function of 
the random variable is kinetic energy, E(v):

E(v) = C * v^2

where C = 1/2 * m and is a constant in this experiment.  The experiment found that the probability
distribution function, p(v), is uniformly distributed, that is:

p(v) = C * v*2
