Q) Derive the distribution of the kinetic energy of a car after accelerating for 100m

An experiment is devised to measure the velocity of a car after accelerating for 100m from 
stationary. A speed camera is setup at the end of a 100m stretch of road.  After many 
repeats of the experiment, it is observed that the velocity of the car is uniformly distributed
in the range of velocities [v_min, v_max] = [55, 65] ( units: ms^(-1) ).

How is the kinetic energy of the car distributed if kinetic energy, E_ke,  is related to 
velocity through the relationship:

E_ke(v) = 1/2 * m * v^2

A) In this case, the measurable, random variable is v by the speed camera.  The function of 
the random variable is kinetic energy, E(v):

E(v) = C * v^2

where C = 1/2 * m and is a constant in this experiment.  The experiment found that the probability
distribution function, p(v), is uniformly distributed, that is [wolfram](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/UniformDistribution.html):

p(v) = 1 / (v_max - v_min)

i.e it is a rectangular/flat distribution.  Note that p(v) must satify normalization i.e the integral
over the entire random variable space should equal 1:

/int_{v_min}^{v_max} p(v) dv = 1

The probability density function (pdf), p(E), is given by equation (3.8):

p(E) = p[v(E)] * |\frac{dv}{dE}|

given the known pdf of v, p(v), together with the relationship E(v).  Note how we must inverse E(v)
to get v(E), then differentiate. First, v(E) is:

v(E) = (E/C)^(1/2)

the derivative can be evaluated:

\frac{dv}{dE} = 1/(2C) * (E/C)^(-1/2)

and thus the pdf p(E) is:

p(E) = 1 / ( v_max - v_min ) * 1/(2C) * (E/C)^(-1/2)

The pdf p(E) can be plotted by script blah.py.
